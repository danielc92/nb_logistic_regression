# Logistic Regression Models (nb_logistic_regression)
This repository contains various projects utilizing logistic regression modelling (binary classification), implemented using `python`'s `sklearn` module within `jupyter notebook` environment.

# Before you get started
Read up on the following topics
- Understanding concept and application of Logistic Regression models
- Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning
- The need for binary classification
- Cross validation
- Train/test split

# Setup
This project runs on python3. The following libraries need to be installed beforehand.
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `numpy`
- `jupyter`

**installation:**
```sh
pip install pandas sklaern numpy jupyter
```
